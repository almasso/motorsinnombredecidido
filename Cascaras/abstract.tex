\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

Although role-playing video games (RPGs) are among the most demanded genres in today's industry, specific engines and editors designed for these type of games are scarce. The most used ones tend to be too generic and are not focused on RPGs specifically.

\smallskip

In addition to this, the available open source RPG engines and editors are often not very user-friendly for newcomers, as they use mechanisms and structures designed for users with advanced knowledge. Those that do offer a more straightforward and practical interface are often locked behind a paywall, so amateur designers find themselves spending the price of a game on the license for a software they will rarely use.

\medskip

To address these problems, this project presents the development of a 2D-video game engine and editor specifically oriented towards RPGs, with cross-platform support, whose objective is to ease the creation of this type of games for users without experience in development or programming, while maintaning more advanced features so that experienced users can generate more complete games, all using open-source and freely accessible tools.
