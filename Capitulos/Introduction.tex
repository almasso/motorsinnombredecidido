\section*{Motivation}
Role-playing video games have been one of the most influential genres in the industry, from their origins in the 1980s to the present day, where they account for a large portion of the market share.

\smallskip

The development of this type of game has undergone major changes over the years, driven by continuous hardware and software improvements, which have allowed us to evolve from machines designed solely to run a single game to the wide range of multimedia devices available today.

\medskip

Numerous video game development and editing tools have appeared in the last two decades, but the more commercial ones are designed for games of all kinds. As a result, they tend to offer more general features that are not closely related to role-playing game development, and they often restrict certain functionality, making the development process more complicated.

\smallskip

Those tools that are specifically designed for role-playing game development have two fundamental flaws:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Those that offer an intuitive, easy-to-use interface that is friendly to newcomers in game development are locked behind a paywall which, although not very expensive, forces amateur users to pay for a software they will rarely unless they consolidate as developers.
	\item Those that are not locked behind a paywall, that is, open source, often have interfaces and systems that are difficult for beginners to understand, leading many to abandon game development due to the complexity of these tools.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The main motivation behind this Project arises from the need to have accessible and flexible tools, both for experimented independent developers who desire to create games without the limitations imposed by general-purpose engines, and for people with little knowledge of video game development or programming.

\section*{Objectives}
This project aims to develop a 2D game engine specifically designed for role-playing games, along with an editor that enables simple and straightforward game development for this engine. The editor will be capable of generating executable files that users can distribute without the need for any additional steps after development.

\smallskip

The editor's interface will be designed for beginners in game development, while still alowing more experienced users to create larger and more ambitious projects.

\medskip

To accomplish this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A cross-platform engine that allows the user to implement role-playing games will be developed.
	\item A cross-platform editor that eases the implementation of a role-playing game in the developed engine will be developed.
	\item The Project will be tested with users to demonstrate its functionality, and necessary conclusions will be drawn, along with potential improvements for the future.
\end{itemize}

To accomplish the previous objectives, the work plan will be divided in three phases: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Research on the current state of engines and editors specifically designed for role-playing games, as well as on role-playing games themselves. This section will aim to identify the common features shared by all engines, editors and games, both open-source and commercial ones, and propose improvements to address the issues these tools may present for inexperienced new users. 
	\item Project Design. Based on the common features identified in the previous phase, an initial design will be proposed to serve as a basis for the development of the Project. This design, while not immutable, should be as close to final as possible to avoid any issues during the development phase.
	\item Project Development. Once the design phase is completed, development will begin. This phase will, in turn, be split across multiple phases:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Setting up the development environment. A development environment will be chosen based on the Project's needs, and everything will be configured to minimize effort during the development of the applications.
			\item Engine development. An engine will be developed according to the previously established plans, with cross-platform support for both PCs and Android mobile devices.
			\item Editor development. Like the engine, the editor will be developed according to the established design.
		\end{itemize}
	\item User testing. To ensure the correct functioning of the Project, the final tools will be tested by a variety of users not involved in their development. After the tests are completed, the necessary conclusions will be drawn, and the Project will be adjusted to address any critical issues that require attention before releasing the public version. Features that would require excessive effort to implement within the available time will be left as future work.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Tools and Methodology}
Regarding the tools, Git will be used as the version control system, with a repository hosted on GitHub and managed through GitHub Desktop. Task management will be carried out using GitHub Projects, available on the GitHub website.

\smallskip

Access to the repository containing the code may be done through this link: \href{https://github.com/almasso/rpgbaker}{\textbf{https://github.com/almasso/rpgbaker}}.

\medskip

Regarding the development tools for the Project, CLion will be used as the C++ development environment, and Android Studio for Android development in Java. CMake will be used as the tool for generating external libraries, and MinGW for handling compilation on Windows, Clang on MacOS, and GCC on Linux. Detailed reasons for choosing these tools can be found in section \ref{sec:decisiones}.

\medskip

On the other hand, PDF generation of the document will be carried out using \LaTeX, with the \texis template, and Texmaker will be used as the editing environment.

\bigskip

Regarding the working methodology, bi-weekly meetings will be proposed with the tutor, although the number of weeks may vary depending on the progress made. During these meetings, the current status of the Project will be presented, and advice related to the design or development of the Project will be requested.

\medskip

Communication with the team will be established through both in-person meetings when important issues need to be addressed and via software that allows messaging and voice chat, such as Discord. This tool will also be used for conducting user testing.

\section*{Document Structure} 
In Chapter \ref{cap:estadoDeLaCuestion}, \textit{State of the Art}, the current situation of role-playing video games, video game development, and a bit of historical context of both will be discussed.

\medskip

In Chapter \ref{cap:planteamiento}, \textit{Project Planning}, the design and decisions made prior to the development of the applications will be discussed in detail.

\medskip

In Chapter \ref{cap:desarrollo}, \textit{Project Development}, the internal structure of the engine and editor in terms of code will be discussed, while addressing the problems encountered during this phase and the solutions proposed.

\medskip

In Chapter \ref{cap:conclusiones}, \textit{Evaluation and Conclusions}, the research questions and objectives will be presented, along with the development of the user testing phase and an analysis of the tests, from which conclusions will be drawn.

\medskip

Finally, in Chapter \ref{cap:trabajoFuturo}, \textit{Future Work}, potential improvements for the final implementation of the applications that may be interest will be detailed.
